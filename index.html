At <a href="https://naturalizationlegalhelp.com/"> Naturalization Legal Help, </a> we specialize in providing personalized legal support to individuals seeking U.S. citizenship, ensuring a smoother and more successful path through the naturalization process.</p>
          
          
          <h2>What is Naturalization?</h2>
               <ul>
               
                <p>Naturalization is the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/naturalization-legal-help/"> legal process </a> by which a foreign-born individual becomes a U.S. citizen. To qualify, applicants must meet specific requirements, such as:

</p>
<ul> <li>
            <p>Having held lawful permanent resident (LPR) status for a minimum of five years (or three years if married to a U.S. citizen)

</p></li>  <li>
            <p>Demonstrating continuous residence and physical presence in the U.S.

</p></li>
<li>
          <p>Showing good moral character</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
          <p>Passing the U.S. citizenship test, which includes English language proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
           
           <p>For many, the naturalization process involves submitting a detailed application, preparing for an interview, and completing the citizenship test all of which can be daunting without the right support.
